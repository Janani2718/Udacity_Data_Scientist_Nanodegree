## Project Motivation:
The main motivation of this project is to analyse the simulated data that mimics customer behavior on the Starbucks rewards mobile app.Through this project I strive to find out different demographic infromation of the offers that Starbucks send out. I have also built a classifier model to predict the response of the given user to the given offer,

- profile.json - demographic data for each customer
- transcript.json - records for transactions, offers received, offers viewed, and offers completed
